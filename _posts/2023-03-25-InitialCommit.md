# The Blog-yssey Begins

I have finally caved in and started to write a blog. The days where I say `If you have time to write a blog post you could have solved 2 LeetCode problems` are gone. I have joined the infamous blogger crowd now.

`Fingers crossed, I had shared the same enthusiasm when I joined a Gym the last few 100 times and look where that had got me ðŸ¤£`.

## But Why?

`Why a blog in the first place? It's not like you are the smartest of the bunch around` True. But learning new ideas and not documenting them was the mistake I did in the previous iterations. As sharing the same pool of brilliants whom I followed till now I understood that I inherited the same flaw they all had. `Forgetfulness` and not to forget the `Procrastination` ðŸ˜ƒ.

Whatever I learned till now is in my head somewhere, but the access to that pointers is long gone ðŸ¤£. I get a puff of the insanities I learned here and there `mostly when I am on the potty`, Unfortunately by the moment I come back and sit in front of the system The *__AHA__* moment would be long gone from me.

To tackle this issue, I am gonna do something nobody else has done till now. Drum rolls .......

__I am gonna write a blog!!__ 

Let me rephrase that properly __I am going to write that blog as ME ðŸ˜ƒ__. The fun way. 
I will let my alter-ego out of its box and help me write the contents interactively. If you hadn't figured it out till now.

> This is me -> Abhijith P M. __*Professional, Coordinated, Hardworking and Loyal*__.
>
> `This is me -> Pm Abi. The one with the charms, with dumb questions, half baked noodles in place of brain and 200% confidence & 0 sarcasm`
{: .promotion }

So back to the question, Why o why am I starting a blog of all things? And here are my X pillars of why.

## 1. The Everlasting Codex

Everyone needs a dairy. Even better if it is a digital one. This blog is like a notebook, But way cooler because it is on the internet. `Till now you were a fool privately, Now you can be a fool publically.`
Now I have something to visit and record my thoughts and edit the things which I thought were right in the future. `Just like the urge we feel to kick ourselves when we find the code that we wrote 3 years ago`. No more lost notes or forgotten concepts.

## 2. Exposure & Validation:

A collective review of our thoughts is an excellent way to improve our thought process. `Or to discard it`. Till now my findings and thoughts were private. I am placing it at the mercy of the world now. `Just like a newbie posting to StackOverflow to get attention`ðŸ¤£.

## 3. Sparking inspiration onto Thy

If I could inspire at least a single person to become 1% better or to impart knowledge. Then Happy++. A friendly rivalry that is mutually beneficial is what society should be built upon. `Kakkarot, that you?`

## 4. Ascension to a Technical Architect

In the long run, my ambitions are tied to being a *Technical Architect* who can hold his own. I want this blog as my stepping stone to my studies, tackling & solving new challenges should be my forte. 

## 5. The Top 1% Club

These days with the AI scare on the run, There is a high need to be in the elite category. Why settle for average when you can be exceptional? Aim for 1% and you would end up in the top 10%. `Why don't you aim for -10%, then won't you end up at 1 percent? Hold my math`.

> Embrace failure as a fleeting moment, for it's in the art of rising that we truly master the dance of success.

`That quote must be from ChatGPT, He ain't that good at coming up with that.` ðŸ¤”
