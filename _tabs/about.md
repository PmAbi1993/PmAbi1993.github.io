# Journey to 10X 

Welcome to My Dev Expeditions, The place where I want to flaunt my thoughts on a journey through the realms of iOS, macOS, AR/VR, and everything in between!

![pmabi](/common/pmabi.jpeg){: width="300" height="300" .w-50 .left}**I am Abhi, Primarily an iOS Developer, Trying to learn the intricacies of Software developing, one sarcastic quip at a time.**

In the daytime, I wear the mask of an **_iOS Developer_**👨‍💻 at a prestigious company. By night, I transform into a keyboard warrior ☣️, sharing my musings, after-thoughts, and decoded riddles on this very blog. With **6+ years of experience** under my belt, I've had the pleasure of working on a myriad of projects that have shaped me into the code-wielding mad scientist that I am today.

> In this blog, I'll try to add a unique blend of __professionalism and sass__. A delightful concoction of **expertise and sarcasm**, guaranteed to keep you entertained while you learn.


Learning should be an entertaining experiance 😃. 

### Welcome aboard, and may the code be with you! 🤲
